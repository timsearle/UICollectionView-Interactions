UICollectionView-Interactions
=============================

---

A project where I have been experimenting with interaction transitions between UICollectionViewLayouts using the new iOS7 APIs.

Usage
-----
---
Running on Simulator or device, use an outward or inward pinch gesture to transition interactively between 3 pre-defined layouts.


_Note:
This is **not** a complete component suitable for dropping into an application, it is just an experiment to see what is possible. No guarantee of stability._
